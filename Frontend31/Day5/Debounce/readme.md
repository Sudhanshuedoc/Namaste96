A responsive and user-friendly weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to search for the current weather in any city, with a few extra enhancements:

  Remembers the last 5–6 searches and shows them in a dropdown or quick-access list for faster access.

- 🎨 **Dynamic Backgrounds**  
  The background of the app changes based on the weather condition:  
  ☀️ Summer / 🌧️ Rainy / ☁️ Cloudy / ❄️ Snowy, etc.

- ⚠️ **Error Handling**  
  If the user enters a city that doesn't exist, a friendly error message is shown.

  Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
